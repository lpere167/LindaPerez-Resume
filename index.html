        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Linda Perez and I am a nineteen year old female who is interested in learning more about Public Policy in hopes of gaining experience in that field. Currently, I am attending the University of California, Riverside as a student athlete in the sport of Cross Country/Track and Field. I am studying to gain my Bachelors in Public Policy so that one day I can have a position within the government. My ultimate career goal is to become a police officer, but before that I would love to take on different roles--one of them being a position holder in the Federal Executive Branch or working at a law firm. I sincerely believe that having a background in public policy and having that governmental experience will benefit me greatly on my path to becoming a police officer. Gaining experience at a higher level will not only allow me to familiarize with the different governmental functions, but it will also broaden my social circle--both important to pursue a path in law enforcement. Furthermore, there are skills that I hold that I believe can be of great use in the field of public policy. Some of these skills include; organization, teamwork, adaptability, project management, critical thinking, active listening, conflict resolution and what I consider most important--passion and hard work. One instance in which I showed both passion and hard work is through my love for sports--specifically running. Throughout my childhood up until my early adulthood I was taught to be a hard worker, from studying hard to earning a place academically and athletically. Being a student athlete at a UC university has taught me what it is to work hard, to be determined and to strive to be better than I was the day before. For example, in my freshman year of highschool I joined track for the first time and was running 5:38 as my personal record for the 2017 season, now, my most recent personal record was 5:07 in the year 2020 during indoor track season. Although it may not seem like much of a time difference, being able to beat a personal record took a lot of determination and taught me how to be passionate. With passion, ambition and a work oriented mind, I feel as though I have the means to succeed  in Public Policy. Public Policy is a field that requires a variety of skills, but it is also one that involves community service and building important community relationships with those around. Over my high school years and even some of college I have been involved within my community and eager to do more. For community service I have done over 180 volunteer hours working in many different areas like; the Second Wind 5K, helping the elder in their retirement homes, selling newspapers for kids day and many more. I also partnered with a church group, Familias Unidas en Cristo, to help support their volunteer opportunities. Ultimately, I believe I have many different aspects that will help change the game for Public Policy.
